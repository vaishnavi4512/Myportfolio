Welcome to my personal portfolio website â€“ a creative, dynamic, and professional online representation of my journey in computer science, research, and music. This project is designed to reflect my identity as a student, intern, researcher, developer, and artist. The portfolio was developed using only front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, demonstrating what can be achieved with foundational web development skills.

The website features a clean and intuitive user interface, responsive layout, stylish hover effects, smooth transitions, and a glowing theme that resonates with my personality. It includes multiple sections such as About, Research, Skills, Hobbies, Projects, and Contact, providing a comprehensive snapshot of my academic, professional, and creative life.

As a BSc Computer Science student at MIT ACSC, I am actively working on real-world projects, engaging in research, and constantly learning new technologies. This portfolio is a live demonstration of my work and serves as my digital identity.
